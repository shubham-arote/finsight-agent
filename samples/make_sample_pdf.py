"""make_sample_pdf.py — a small multi-page, born-digital PDF that mimics an annual report.

Ported from financial_analyst_agent. The financial statements are drawn as *ruled* tables
(grid lines) so PyMuPDF's conservative line-based `find_tables()` detects them as real
tables, while headings and prose stay separate. Deterministic — the retrieval baseline's
labelled QA set (evals/datasets/sample_report_qa.json) is keyed to these pages.
